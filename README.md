# pedestal-app-tutorial

This project will host the in-progress version of the Pedestal app
tutorial. Once the tutorial is finished, the source code will be moved
to the Pedestal `samples` project and the documents in the wiki will be
moved to Pedestal documentation.

The tutorial is located in the wiki.
