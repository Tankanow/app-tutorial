# Pedestal-app Tutorial [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/app-tutorial.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/app-tutorial)

Welcome to the Pedestal-app Tutorial! This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through pedestal-app in its entirety.

The tutorial is located in the [Wiki](../../wiki) and is composed of 34 sections across two parts. During the course
of the tutorial you'll construct an interactive multi-player bubble-popping game that exercises nearly every nook and
cranny of pedestal-app.

### [Get Started!](../../wiki)

## Contributing

Oh my, how gracious of you. It's a little bit more difficult than a typical software to contribute to the tutorial
however; We have ~34 tags to maintain as pointers from the tutorial, and the Wiki is locked away in GitHub-wikidom.

If you're desperate to help, reach out by [creating an issue](../../issues/new), and we'll see what we can do.

## Running the final game

It's easiest to follow along in the tutorial, but if you'd like to run the final game follow these steps. It's
assumed you have [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial
cd app-tutorial

# In one terminal
cd tutorial-client
lein repl
> (dev)
> (watch :development)

# In another terminal
cd tutorial-service
lein repl
> (use 'dev)
> (start)
```

Now visit <http://localhost:8080/tutorial-client-dev.html> and "log in" (just pick a name :wink:). Get poppin'!
